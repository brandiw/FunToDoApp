## To-Do List Development Process

### Day 1 (2 hours)

* Set up empty project and Github repo
* Familiarize with typescript

* Begin outline of to-do list app

### Day 2: Part 1 (3 hours)

* Set up readme
* Fleshed out some styling in to-do list
* Adding top-level (parent) items implemented
* Deleting whole list of items implemented
* Mark done functionality works
* Timezone bug solved / Dates working and comparing correctly
* Conditional displays added
    * Three states for due dates: 
        * past (blue),
        * due soon (yellow)
        * due later (green)
    * Buttons to mark done or add sub-items only appear when not done

My plan:
